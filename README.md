## So what is this exactly?

This is a CLI built by [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theosakram/) to streamline the setup of the projects that I frequently do. So yes, this is a _very opinionated_ stacks, and this is also **NOT** an all-inclusive template.

## Getting Started

If you want to install it on your local

```bash
yarn global add theosakram-cli
```

and after that you can run this command on your terminal, like so:

```bash
theosakram-create
```

Or if you dont want to install it on your local

```bash
npx theosakram-create
```
